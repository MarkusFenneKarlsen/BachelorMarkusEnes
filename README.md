# Bachelor Thesis project by Markus & Enes

This is the source code for our bachelor thesis project.

You may download this whole repo as a zip file, extract it and then compile it. ICECCME.py is the file that runs the Jaiswal & Davidrajuh's algorithm.

Depending on what kind of enviroment you run the Python code in, you might have to type something like this in the console:
pip3 install numpy

This project uses NumPy as a good matrix library for Python, in order to get access to much of the 
same default functionality as MATLAB.
