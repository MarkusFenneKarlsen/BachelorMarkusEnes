# Bachelor Thesis project by Markus & Enes

This is the source code for our bachelor thesis project. The "Ressurser" directory are the resources provided to us from Reggie Davidrajuh and is NOT our work. Our implementation of the Jaiswal & Davidrajuh's algorithm and the rest of our Python code is in the directory "Kode".

You may download this whole repo as a zip file, extract it and then compile it. ICECCME.py is the file that runs the Jaiswal & Davidrajuh's algorithm.

Depending on what kind of enviroment you run the Python code in, you might have to type something like this in the console:
pip3 install numpy

This project uses NumPy as a good matrix library for Python, in order to get access to much of the 
same default functionality as MATLAB.
